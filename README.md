## Why StudyGenius Pro? 

Study GeniusPro offers various features to aid students across all education levels. 
There is a direct correlation between where you are from in Silicon Valley and their academic performances. Due to the reliance on neighboring property taxes for public school funding, districts with higher property values receive more financial resources. These funds are then invested in comprehensive learning programs for their students. In contrast, schools in lower-value property areas receive less funding, limiting their access to quality educational resources and making their learning experience more challenging. Our group tackled the goal number four of quality education in the Silicon Valley where our mission is to help underprivileged students have readily available resources to study.
